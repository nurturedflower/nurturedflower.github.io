                    Spitfire is the debut extended play (EP) by
                    American electronic music producer Porter
                    Robinson, released on September 13, 2011,
                    through Owsla.
                    After releasing his 2010 single "Say My Name",
                    Robinson expressed desire to explore different
                    musical genres by producing an EP, diverging
                    from his traditional eurodance style.

                    Worlds is the debut studio album by the
                    American electronic music producer Porter
                    Robinson, released on August 12, 2014, by
                    Astralwerks. Initially known for his heavier
                    bass-centric production, Robinson became
                    increasingly dissatisfied with the electronic
                    dance music (EDM) genre, believing it limited
                    his artistic expression.

                    Nurture is the second studio album by
                    American electronic music producer Porter
                    Robinson, released on April 23, 2021, by
                    Mom + Pop Music. The album was written in
                    the years following Robinson's debut album
                    Worlds (2014), a period when Robinson
                    struggled with mental illness and writer's
                    block. As a result, the album represents a
                    significant stylistic shift in his work;
                    critics noted that the album features a
                    greater emphasis on acoustic instruments
                    and personal lyrics, while retaining many
                    elements of the innovative electronic style
                    of Worlds.

                    Smile! :D (stylized in all caps) is the third
                    studio album by American electronic music
                    producer Porter Robinson, released on July
                    26, 2024, through Mom + Pop Music. In
                    recording the album, Robinson sought to break
                    away from many stylistic elements of his previous
                    work. The music on the record draws from pop-punk,
                    early 2000s rave, and hyperpop influences.
