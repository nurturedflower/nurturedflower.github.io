            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement,
            <sup>[1]</sup> canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or
            inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon
            observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of
            fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a 
            canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup>
            The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the
            same species, but also occurs between trees of different
            species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup> There exist many
            hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive
            behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit
            spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

        <p>
            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is
            uncertain.<sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed
            in scientific literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup>
            The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might
            suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across
            different species, an example of convergent
            evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy
            branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees:
            trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide
            with each other during winds; the abrasions and collisions
            induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that
            lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours
            until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup>
            If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding
            in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy
            gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown
            shyness between branches of the same organism.
            Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly
            seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including
            windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early
            succession forests where branches are flexible and limited
            in lateral movement.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[12]</sup>
            According to this theory, variable flexibility in
            lateral branches greatly influences the degree of
            crown shyness.

            Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion
            at growth nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable
            to continue with lateral growth. Australian forester
            M.R. Jacobs, who studied the crown shyness patterns in
            eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the trees' growing tips
            were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy
            gaps.<sup>[13]</sup> Miguel Franco (1986) observed that
            the branches of <i>Picea sitchensis</i> (Sitka spruce) and
            <i>Larix kaempferi</i> (Japanese larch) suffered physical
            damage due to abrasion, which killed the leading
            shoots.<sup>[14]</sup><sup>[15]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do
            with mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. The
            photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a
            well-documented behavior in a variety of plant
            species.<sup>[16]</sup> Neighbor detection is thought
            to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants
            can sense the proximity of neighbors by sensing
            backscattered far-red light, a task widely thought to
            be accomplished by the activity of the phytochrome
            photoreceptors.<sup>[17]</sup> Many species of plant
            respond to an increase in far-red light (and, by extension,
            encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from
            the far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of
            elongation.<sup>[18]</sup> Similarly, plants use blue
            light to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely
            playing a role in the recognition of neighboring
            plants,<sup>[19]</sup> though this was just starting to be
            recognised in 1988.<sup>[20]</sup>
