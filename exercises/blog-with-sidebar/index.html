                    Hello, blog. It's me, Joshua.
                    <br>
                    It's been a hot minute since I've wrote
                    something here.
                    <br>
                    Not much has changed after the family
                    vacation I had with my dad, my sister, and my
                    girlfriend, Estelle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of Estelle...
                    <br>
                    I've been looking back at the confession that
                    happened between us way back when, after I
                    found out that I was a part of Ouroboros,
                    and didn't want Estelle to follow me.
                </p>

                <h3>"My Estelle..
                    You shine like the sun."
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Ever since that night, I've always expressed
                    deep regret and remorse for leaving her like
                    that.. and so suddenly, too.
                    <br>
                    I didn't mean to leave her that night.
                    <br>
                    It must've hurt her to let her do everything
                    at home without me there.. by her side.
