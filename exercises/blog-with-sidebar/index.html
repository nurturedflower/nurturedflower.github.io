                <p>
                    Hello, blog. It's me, Joshua.
                    <br>
                    It's been a hot minute since I've wrote
                    something here.
                    <br>
                    Not much has changed after the family
                    vacation I had with my dad, my sister, and my
                    girlfriend, Estelle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of Estelle...
                    <br>
                    I've been looking back at the confession that
                    happened between us way back when, after I
                    found out that I was a part of Ouroboros,
                    and didn't want Estelle to follow me.
                </p>
                <br>

                    alt="joshua confession"
                >
                <h3>
                    "My Estelle..
                    You shine like the sun."
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Ever since that night, I've always expressed
                    deep regret and remorse for leaving her like
                    that.. and so suddenly, too.
                    <br>
                    I didn't mean to leave her that night.
                    <br>
                    It must've hurt her to let her do everything
                    at home without me there.. by her side.
                </p>

                >
                <h3>
                    "...I want you to know that I'll always be
                    thinking of you."
                </h3>
                <p>
                    And ever since that night, I was always
                    thinking of her, especially on my journey to
                    seek out the Society.
                    <br>
                    However, as I was on my journey to seek out
                    the Society, later to be known as Ouroboros,
                    Estelle managed to find me later on in the
                    journey, somehow.
                    <br>
                    I had to get away from her as best as I can,
                    and as fast as I can, too.
                    <br>
                    I didn't want her to get hurt, or get in my way
                    of finding the Society and taking them down.
                    <br>
                    Later on down the line, however, Estelle found
                    me again, but this time, as I was with Josette
                    and a few others.
                    <br>
                    As we talked, however, she saw through my
                    self-pity, and told me I wasn't broken, and
                    that I was scared of losing someone else I loved.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    "You're just scared, mostly because you care
                    for people so much it breaks your heart... and
                    you're lying to yourself about it."
                </h3>
                <p>
                    And she was right..
                    <br>
                    I was scared.
                    <br>
                    I was scared of losing more people I love and
                    care about.. especially Estelle.
                    <br>
                    Little did I know, though..
                    <br>
                    The next moment, she hugged me from behind.
                </p>

                >
                <p>
                    And told me...
                </p>
                <h3>
                    "Let's go foward together from now on and

                </h3>
                <p>
                    I started crying afterwards.
                    I wasn't able to cry tears ever since my sister,
                    Karin, died.
                </p>

                >
                <p>
                    From that moment on, we went on many adventures
                    together.
                    And overcame so much throughout our time
                    together.
                    And I'm so, so grateful to have Estelle in
                    my life now, and hopefully forever.
