                        Trails in the Sky</span><sup>[c]</sup>
                        is a 2004 role-playing video game developed
                        by Nihon Falcom. The game is the first in
                        what later became known as the
                        <span id="game-series-title">Trails</span> series,
                        itself a part of the larger
                        <span id="series-title">The Legend of

                    <span id="game-title-text">Trails in the Sky</span>
                    was first released in Japan for Windows and
                    was later ported to the PlayStation Portable
                    in 2006. North American video game publisher
                    Xseed Games acquired the rights from Falcom,
                    but did not release it until 2011 due to the
                    game's large amount of text necessary to translate
                    and localize. A high-definition port to the
                    PlayStation 3 was released in 2012, while a
                    remaster for the PlayStation Vita was released
                    in 2015; both were only released in Japan.
                    A sequel, <span id="game-title-text-2">Trails in
                        the Sky SC</span>, was released in 2006. A remake,
                        <span id="game-title-text-3">Trails in the Sky
                        the 1st</span>, is scheduled to be released on the
                            Nintendo Switch worldwide in 2025.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p id="gameplay-text">
                    In <span id="game-title-text">Trails in the Sky</span>,
                    the player controls a cast of characters,
                    embarking on quests to progress the story. There
                    are two different types of maps when navigating the
                    overworld, field maps and town maps. In field
                    maps, enemies roam around and a battle ensues
                    if the player comes into contact with one. In
                    town maps, the player can visit various shops
                    to purchase items, replenish health at an inn
                    and, for the major cities, take on and report
                    quests to the local guild. Quests can be a
                    variety of tasks for the player, ranging
                    from defeating monsters in the field map to
                    delivering items and finding lost cats in town.
                    In addition, the player can interact with numerous
                    non-playable characters (NPCs). A unique aspect in
                    Trails in the Sky is that each NPC's dialogue changes
                    as the story progresses, allowing players to follow
                    their accompanying side stories throughout
                    the game.<sup>[1]</sup> The game features 8 playable
                    characters, who apart from the protagonists
                    Estelle and Joshua, rotate in and out of the
                    party while playing the main story. The story
                    itself is split into five different portions,
                    with a prologue followed by four chapters.
