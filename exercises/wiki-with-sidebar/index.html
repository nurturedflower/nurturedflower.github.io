                    is a 2004 role-playing video game developed
                    by Nihon Falcom. The game is the first in
                    what later became known as the
                    <span id="game-series-title">Trails</span>
                    series, itself a part of the larger

                    was first released in Japan for Windows and
                    was later ported to the PlayStation Portable
                    in 2006. North American video game publisher
                    Xseed Games acquired the rights from Falcom,
                    but did not release it until 2011 due to the
                    game's large amount of text necessary to translate
                    and localize. A high-definition port to the
                    PlayStation 3 was released in 2012, while a
                    remaster for the PlayStation Vita was released
                    in 2015; both were only released in Japan.

                    In <span id="italic">Trails in the Sky</span>,
                    the player controls a cast of characters,
                    embarking on quests to progress the story. There
                    are two different types of maps when navigating the
                    overworld, field maps and town maps. In field
                    maps, enemies roam around and a battle ensues
                    if the player comes into contact with one. In
                    town maps, the player can visit various shops
                    to purchase items, replenish health at an inn
                    and, for the major cities, take on and report
                    quests to the local guild. Quests can be a
                    variety of tasks for the player, ranging
                    from defeating monsters in the field map to
                    delivering items and finding lost cats in town.
                    In addition, the player can interact with numerous
                    non-playable characters (NPCs). A unique aspect in
                    Trails in the Sky is that each NPC's dialogue changes
                    as the story progresses, allowing players to follow
                    their accompanying side stories throughout
                    the game.<sup>[1]</sup> The game features 8 playable
                    characters, who apart from the protagonists
                    Estelle and Joshua, rotate in and out of the
                    party while playing the main story. The story
                    itself is split into five different portions,
                    with a prologue followed by four chapters.
                </p>
                <p id="gameplay-text-2">
                    Combat takes place on a grid and is
                    turn-based. The character's turn order is
                    determined by a tracker called the AT Bar.
                    During the character's turn, the player can
                    move or make an attack. In addition to the
                    normal attack, each character also has three
                    other methods available for action: Arts, Crafts,
                    and S-Crafts. Arts are magic spells characters can
                    use to attack opponents or support teammates but
                    must take an additional turn to cast. Crafts are
                    character-specific abilities that are similar to
                    Arts but can be used in the same turn, but they
                    utilize a special gauge called "Craft Points" (CP)
                    for the cost to perform. S-Crafts are powered-up
                    Crafts that can be performed once a character
                    has over 100CP but completely depletes the CP
                    gauge upon using it. Further extending S-Crafts
                    are S-Breaks which allows characters to immediately
                    perform an S-Craft regardless of when their
                    turn order is.<sup>[2][3]</sup> An additional
                    aspect of combat is AT Bonuses which grant bonus
                    effects at certain turns throughout the battle,
                    visible on the AT Bar.<sup>[2][3]</sup> If the
                    player loses a battle, the game is over. The
                    player is then allowed to continuously retry
                    the battle and subsequently lower the difficulty
                    of the battle for each retry. Earlier versions
                    of the game included two difficulty settings,
                    Normal and Hard, while later versions introduced
                    a third difficulty known as Nightmare.<sup>[2][3]</sup>

                <p>
                    The game follows protagonists Estelle Bright
                    and her adopted brother Joshua, who journey
                    through the country of Liberl to train to
                    become senior Bracers, members of a
                    non-governmental multinational organization
                    that acts to keep the peace and protect
                    civilians. During the journey, they get
                    embroiled in and eventually stop an
                    attempted coup to overthrow the monarchy.

                    During the celebratory party after the
                    incident is resolved, Joshua encounters
                    Professor Alba, whom they met during their
                    quest. Alba reveals that he is actually
                    Georg Weissmann, a member of a secret
                    crime organization called Ouroboros,
                    who had been forcing Joshua to unknowingly
                    act as their spy on the Bright family.
                    After Weissman fully restores Joshua's
                    memories, Joshua decides to leave the Bracer
                    Guild to take on the society independently, but
                    not before confessing his feelings to Estelle
                    (while drugging her so he could not be
                    followed).

                    Windows on June 29, 2004, in Japan. The game was
                    later ported to the PlayStation Portable and
                    released in Japan on October 28, 2006. The PSP
                    version was later released by Xseed Games in
                    North America on March 29, 2011, and in Europe
                    on November 4. The Windows version was released
                    worldwide on July 29, 2014, and included a
                    number of features from the PlayStation Portable

                    The game was localized into English by
                    Xseed Games, who had acquired the rights
                    to bring the Trails in the Sky trilogy
                    to North America in May 2010.<sup>[9][10]</sup>
                    The length of the script for

                    </span>
                    , which contains approximately 1.5 million
                    Japanese characters, presented a challenge
                    for the team's editors.<sup>[11]</sup> Jessica Chavez,
                    the game's lead editor, spent nine months
                    working on the script. Chavez stated that
                    she would frequently work over 11-12 hours
                    for six days a week.<sup>[11][12]</sup> In 2013, Xseed
                    planned a Windows version of

                    issues forced the release date to be pushed
                    back to July. According to Xseed localization
                    programmer Sara Leen, much of the code
                    needed to be rewritten from scratch because
                    of technical differences between the
                    PlayStation Portable and Windows versions;
                    these changes frequently introduced new
                    software bugs, further complicating

                    aggregator Metacritic.<sup>[18][19]</sup>
                    Neilie Johnson of IGN gave it a positive
                    review, stating that, though "First Chapter
                    is not the most original ever made, like any
                    good JRPG it offers amusing writing, dynamic
                    combat, interesting tasks, an absorbing
                    narrative, and hours upon hours of gameplay"
                    and concluded that "while the game's 50/50
                    balance between combat and story may not be to
                    everyone's taste, its charm and overall
                    entertainment value make it well worth the
                    investment".<sup>[25]</sup> Hardcore Gamer
                    praised the "rock-solid character writing",
                    noting every character has "their own
                    history, ambitions, and social connections",
                    every non-player character (NPC) "has their
                    own name and motivations and interpersonal
                    relationships with other NPCs", and the
                    influence of Hayao Miyazaki's classic anime
                    film Castle in the Sky on the cast and
                    steampunk setting. They also praised the
                    open-ended story, quest design, and combat
                    system, and for having "one of the most
                    complete and enthralling worlds ever
                    rendered", concluding it to be "one of the

                    PSP,<sup>[29]</sup> but USGamer's Kat Bailey
                    described its later Playstation Vita
                    availability and PC port as a useful
                    revenue stream with little overhead for
                    niche publisher Xseed Games.<sup>[30]</sup>
                    It was named the best RPG of 2011 by
                    RPGFan.com<sup>[31][32]</sup> and among the
                    best games of the year in
                    general by Wired.<sup>[33]</sup>
