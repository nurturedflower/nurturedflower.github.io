                    <sup>[c]</sup>
                    is a 2004 role-playing video game developed
                    by Nihon Falcom. The game is the first in
                    what later became known as the
                    <span id="game-series-title">Trails</span>
                    series, itself a part of the larger
                    <span id="series-title">
                        The Legend of Heroes
                    </span>
                    series.

                    was first released in Japan for Windows and
                    was later ported to the PlayStation Portable
                    in 2006. North American video game publisher
                    Xseed Games acquired the rights from Falcom,
                    but did not release it until 2011 due to the
                    game's large amount of text necessary to translate
                    and localize. A high-definition port to the
                    PlayStation 3 was released in 2012, while a
                    remaster for the PlayStation Vita was released
                    in 2015; both were only released in Japan.
                    A sequel,

                        was released in 2006. A remake,

                            is scheduled to be released on the

                    In <span id="game-title-text">Trails in the Sky</span>,
                    the player controls a cast of characters,
                    embarking on quests to progress the story. There
                    are two different types of maps when navigating the
                    overworld, field maps and town maps. In field
                    maps, enemies roam around and a battle ensues
                    if the player comes into contact with one. In
                    town maps, the player can visit various shops
                    to purchase items, replenish health at an inn
                    and, for the major cities, take on and report
                    quests to the local guild. Quests can be a
                    variety of tasks for the player, ranging
                    from defeating monsters in the field map to
                    delivering items and finding lost cats in town.
                    In addition, the player can interact with numerous
                    non-playable characters (NPCs). A unique aspect in
                    Trails in the Sky is that each NPC's dialogue changes
                    as the story progresses, allowing players to follow
                    their accompanying side stories throughout
                    the game.<sup>[1]</sup> The game features 8 playable
                    characters, who apart from the protagonists
                    Estelle and Joshua, rotate in and out of the
                    party while playing the main story. The story
                    itself is split into five different portions,
                    with a prologue followed by four chapters.

                    Combat takes place on a grid and is
                    turn-based. The character's turn order is
                    determined by a tracker called the AT Bar.
                    During the character's turn, the player can
                    move or make an attack. In addition to the
                    normal attack, each character also has three
                    other methods available for action: Arts, Crafts,
                    and S-Crafts. Arts are magic spells characters can
                    use to attack opponents or support teammates but
                    must take an additional turn to cast. Crafts are
                    character-specific abilities that are similar to
                    Arts but can be used in the same turn, but they
                    utilize a special gauge called "Craft Points" (CP)
                    for the cost to perform. S-Crafts are powered-up
                    Crafts that can be performed once a character
                    has over 100CP but completely depletes the CP
                    gauge upon using it. Further extending S-Crafts
                    are S-Breaks which allows characters to immediately
                    perform an S-Craft regardless of when their
                    turn order is.<sup>[2][3]</sup> An additional
                    aspect of combat is AT Bonuses which grant bonus
                    effects at certain turns throughout the battle,
                    visible on the AT Bar.<sup>[2][3]</sup> If the
                    player loses a battle, the game is over. The
                    player is then allowed to continuously retry
                    the battle and subsequently lower the difficulty
                    of the battle for each retry. Earlier versions
                    of the game included two difficulty settings,
                    Normal and Hard, while later versions introduced
                    a third difficulty known as Nightmare.<sup>[2][3]</sup>
