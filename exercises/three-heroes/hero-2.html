                    You've told me something comforting.

                    Then you said:
                    <br>
                    "Don't think of the time that's left
                    <br>
                    You're spending it in your head,
                    <br>
                    I just want you laughing"
                    <br>
                    I started crying.
                    <br>
                    "I'm sorry for crying," I said.
