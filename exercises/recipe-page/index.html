            The viral Kanafeh-inspired Chocolate Bar from a dessert
            spot called The Fix in Dubai has been going viral and
            since lots of us are a plane ride away, we’re going to

            it’s so easy to make.

        <h1>THE SHREDDED PHYLLO</h1>

        <p>
            We’re going to break this recipe down into sections
            based on each component in this recipe! Now if you
            don’t know yet, the name of this chocolate bar is
            called Can’t Get Knafeh of It with Knafeh being a
            play on the word enough. Knafeh is a Palestinian
            dessert popular throughout all of the Arab world
            that is made with crispy buttery phyllo strands and
            stuffed with a sweet cheese filling. It’s usually
            covered in a simple syrup and then topped with lots
            of pistachios. This chocolate bar takes everything
            from the traditional dessert minus the
            sweet cheese.
        </p>

        <p>
            We’re going to start with the shredded phyllo dough
            which is also called kataifi in Arabic. You can find it
            at most Arab/Middle Eastern grocery stores and this is
            what the packaging looks like. Apollo Athens Food is my
            favorite brand to use for kataifi.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now if you happen to not have any Arab markets next to
            you, here are some other options you can use. There is
            nothing that compares to the real thing but there are
            some other ingredients that can add a crunch. You can
            use puffed rice or puffed quinoa!
        </p>

        <p>
            To prepare the kataifi, start by cutting it up into
            1/4 to 1/2 inch long pieces. Kataifi usually comes in
            a package where it is all lumped up in an oval so you
            have to cut it. Once it’s cut, it’s time to heat up
            some vegetable oil in a frying pan. I prefer frying
            it for this recipe so it’s all evenly toasted and it
            gives you the best crispy texture. Once the oil is hot,
            350°F, add the shredded phyllo in and fry until
            beautifully golden. Make sure to stir it around as
            it cooks so it evenly fries. If you are only frying one
            pan it’ll be easier to set up a bowl with a strainer
            above and just strain out the shredded phyllo
            from the oil.
        </p>

        <h2 id="recipe">PISTACHIO STUFFED CHOCOLATE BAR</h2>

        <p>
            The viral Kanafeh-inspired Chocolate Bar from a dessert
            spot called The Fix in Dubai has been going viral and
            since lots of us are a plane ride away, we're going
            to make it at home and even better! Oozing with pistachio

        </p>

        <p>
            Transfer the fried phyllo to a plate with a paper towel
            to drain excess oil. Set aside to let it cool down a bit.

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 cup pistachio paste/butter
            </li>
            <li>
                1 to 1/2 cup shredded phyllo or kataifi, cut into
                small pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                vegetable oil, for frying
            </li>
            <li>
                2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 cup white chocolate, melted
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan to 350°F.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Add the shredded phyllo in and fry until golden and
                crispy. If frying another batch, use a slotted spoon
                to take out the fried phyllo. Transfer to a plate with
                a paper towel to drain excess oil.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                If you are not frying another batch, it'll be easier
                to set up a bowl with a strainer and pour the pan over
                to let the oil drain and the strainer
                catch the phyllo.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Allow the fried phyllo to cool down for 15 minutes.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Add the pistachio paste to a mixing bowl along with
                the fried phyllo and mix together to combine.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                OPTIONAL: To the chocolate mold, add a light drizzle
                of white chocolate.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Then add in about 1/4 cup or more of melted milk
                chocolate and shake it around to cover the bottom
                and sides completely.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>
                Pop in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes
                until hard.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Take the mold out and fill the chocolate mold with
                the pistachio and phyllo mixture almost all
                the way to the top.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Cover the filling entirely with more melted chocolate
                and pop it back in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15
                minutes until hard.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Once set, pop out of the mold and enjoy!
            </li>
