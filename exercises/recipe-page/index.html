            The viral Kanafeh-inspired Chocolate Bar from a dessert
            spot called The Fix in Dubai has been going viral and
            since lots of us are a plane ride away, we’re going to

            it’s so easy to make.

        <h1>THE SHREDDED PHYLLO</h1>

        <p>
            We’re going to break this recipe down into sections
            based on each component in this recipe! Now if you
            don’t know yet, the name of this chocolate bar is
            called Can’t Get Knafeh of It with Knafeh being a
            play on the word enough. Knafeh is a Palestinian
            dessert popular throughout all of the Arab world
            that is made with crispy buttery phyllo strands and
            stuffed with a sweet cheese filling. It’s usually
            covered in a simple syrup and then topped with lots
            of pistachios. This chocolate bar takes everything
            from the traditional dessert minus the
            sweet cheese.
        </p>

        <p>
            We’re going to start with the shredded phyllo dough
            which is also called kataifi in Arabic. You can find it
            at most Arab/Middle Eastern grocery stores and this is
            what the packaging looks like. Apollo Athens Food is my
            favorite brand to use for kataifi.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now if you happen to not have any Arab markets next to
            you, here are some other options you can use. There is
            nothing that compares to the real thing but there are
            some other ingredients that can add a crunch. You can
            use puffed rice or puffed quinoa!
        </p>

        <p>
            To prepare the kataifi, start by cutting it up into
            1/4 to 1/2 inch long pieces. Kataifi usually comes in
            a package where it is all lumped up in an oval so you
            have to cut it. Once it’s cut, it’s time to heat up
            some vegetable oil in a frying pan. I prefer frying
            it for this recipe so it’s all evenly toasted and it
            gives you the best crispy texture. Once the oil is hot,
            350°F, add the shredded phyllo in and fry until
            beautifully golden. Make sure to stir it around as
            it cooks so it evenly fries. If you are only frying one
            pan it’ll be easier to set up a bowl with a strainer
            above and just strain out the shredded phyllo
            from the oil.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h1>THE PISTACHIO BUTTER</h1>

        <p>
            Moving on to the second component – PISTACHIO BUTTER!
            I posted a teaser for this recipe on the internet and
            I was shocked to see so many people did not know what
            pistachio paste/butter is. Everyone thought it was
            guacamole or other sorts of inedible things. Arabs use
            pistachios and pistachio butter in a lot of our
            desserts so it’s totally normal to see a green color.
            But anyway, my favorite brand of Pistachio Butter to
            use is Gusto, and <b>here is the link here to buy
            it</b>. It has the creamiest consistency and a
            beautiful vibrant green color.
        </p>

        <p>
            If it is a little too solid when you open the jar,
            you can pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Add
            the pistachio butter to a bowl along with the fried
            shredded phyllo. Mix together well and now the
            filling is ready to go!
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                NOTE:
            </b>
            Another option instead of buying pistachio
            butter is to make it yourself from scratch. You
            just need to blend pistachios in a strong food
            processor/blender for a really long time until it
            resembles nut butter. You can then mix it with
            melted white chocolate or sweetened condensed
            milk to make it more smooth or creamy.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h1>THE MOLDS</h1>

        <p>
            The hardest part is done, the filling! We have
            one more thing to discuss before we move into
            actually making the chocolate bars. I want to
            make sure to cover any questions you might have.
        </p>

        <p>
            What makes the Dubai Chocolate Bars unique is
            that they are really thick since they are stuffed
            with pistachio filling. It can be hard to find
            molds that are thick enough but it took me a bit of
            searching before I stumbled on the perfect one. Here
            is the link to the one I got but it is currently out
            of stock. There are so many other mold options
            available and although they might not be as
            thick, they will still be just as
            delicious.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                NOTE:
            </b>
            If you don’t want to order a mold, you
            can use a loaf pan used to make cake to create the
            chocolate bar. Get creative!
        </p>

        <br>

        <h1>ASSEMBLING THE BARS</h1>

        <p>
            Ok let’s get really into it now! Start by melting
            down some milk chocolate. You can also use semi-sweet
            or dark if that’s your preference. <b>Here is the
            link to the milk chocolate</b> I use. It melts so
            beautifully every single time and I highly
            recommend it. Just add the chocolate to a
            microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30-second
            intervals, stirring each time until
            completely melted.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pour about 1/4 cup of melted chocolate into each
            mold and shake it around until the bottom and
            sides are fully coated in chocolate. You may need
            more or less chocolate depending on the mold size
            you use. Transfer the molds to the refrigerator or
            freezer for 10 to 15 minutes until it is solid.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now add a generous amount of the crispy pistachio
            filling in the center until almost full to the
            top but not all the way. Pour more melted chocolate
            to cover the top entirely and transfer back to the
            fridge/freezer until set.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then flip over the mold and the chocolate bar
            should pop right out!
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                NOTE:
            </b>
            If you want to create a design on the bar,
            you can add edible gold dust to the bottom of the
            mold before adding anything in. Another option is
            to drizzle melted white chocolate or white chocolate
            with colored dye added. Then you can pour that first
            layer of milk chocolate in after and continue on
            with the rest of the steps.
        </p>

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 cup pistachio paste/butter
            </li>
            <li>
                1 to 1/2 cup shredded phyllo or kataifi, cut into
                small pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                vegetable oil, for frying
            </li>
            <li>
                2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 cup white chocolate, melted
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan to 350°F.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Add the shredded phyllo in and fry until golden and
                crispy. If frying another batch, use a slotted spoon
                to take out the fried phyllo. Transfer to a plate with
                a paper towel to drain excess oil.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                If you are not frying another batch, it'll be easier
                to set up a bowl with a strainer and pour the pan over
                to let the oil drain and the strainer
                catch the phyllo.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Allow the fried phyllo to cool down for 15 minutes.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Add the pistachio paste to a mixing bowl along with
                the fried phyllo and mix together to combine.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                OPTIONAL: To the chocolate mold, add a light drizzle
                of white chocolate.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Then add in about 1/4 cup or more of melted milk
                chocolate and shake it around to cover the bottom
                and sides completely.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>
                Pop in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes
                until hard.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Take the mold out and fill the chocolate mold with
                the pistachio and phyllo mixture almost all
                the way to the top.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Cover the filling entirely with more melted chocolate
                and pop it back in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15
                minutes until hard.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Once set, pop out of the mold and enjoy!
