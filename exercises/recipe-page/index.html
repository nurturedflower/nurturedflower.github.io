            The viral Kanafeh-inspired Chocolate Bar from a dessert
            spot called The Fix in Dubai has been going viral and
            since lots of us are a plane ride away, we're going to make
            it at home and even better! Oozing with pistachio butter
            and crispy toasted shredded phyllo bits, this chocolate
            is the definition of indulgence. Every single bite is so
            creamy but also so crispy at the same time and the taste
            is so reminiscent of everyone's
            favorite Arab dessert!

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 cup pistachio paste/butter
            </li>
            <li>
                1 to 1/2 cup shredded phyllo or kataifi, cut into
                small pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                vegetable oil, for frying
            </li>
            <li>
                2 to 3 cups milk chocolate, melted
            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 cup white chocolate, melted
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan to 350Â°F.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Add the shredded phyllo in and fry until golden and
                crispy. If frying another batch, use a slotted spoon
                to take out the fried phyllo. Transfer to a plate with
                a paper towel to drain excess oil.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                If you are not frying another batch, it'll be easier
                to set up a bowl with a strainer and pour the pan over
                to let the oil drain and the strainer
                catch the phyllo.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Allow the fried phyllo to cool down for 15 minutes.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Add the pistachio paste to a mixing bowl along with
                the fried phyllo and mix together to combine.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                OPTIONAL: To the chocolate mold, add a light drizzle
                of white chocolate.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Then add in about 1/4 cup or more of melted milk
                chocolate and shake it around to cover the bottom
                and sides completely.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>
                Pop in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15 minutes
                until hard.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Take the mold out and fill the chocolate mold with
                the pistachio and phyllo mixture almost all
                the way to the top.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Cover the filling entirely with more melted chocolate
                and pop it back in the fridge or freezer for 10 to 15
                minutes until hard.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Once set, pop out of the mold and enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
